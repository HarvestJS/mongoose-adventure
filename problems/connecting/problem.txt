To get started we need to connect to the database.

{red}1.{/red} Write a Node program that connects to a mongo database using {bold}createConnection{/bold}.
{red}2.{/red} Log {bold}Connected!{/bold} when the database object fires a {bold}connected{/bold} event.
{red}3.{/red} Remember to call {bold}process.exit(){/bold} when your program is finished!

The database is located at {bold}{green}mongodb://localhost:9001/workshop{/green}{/bold}

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  {bold}{appname} run program.js{/bold}

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  {bold}{appname} verify program.js{/bold}

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `{bold}{appname}{/bold}` again and select the next problem!
